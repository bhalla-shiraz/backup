SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is an XML format used for drawing.
You can think of SVG in a lot of the same terms as the DOM – there are elements with parents and children and attributes, and you can respond to the same mouse/touch events.
Even CSS styles and selectors can apply to SVG elements. The CSS attribute names for SVG come from the SVG definition, so they are sometimes different from their HTML brethren.

rect> and <circle> and <line>
Where HTML has the <div> and <span> tags, SVG has the <g> tag for an arbitrary group.
